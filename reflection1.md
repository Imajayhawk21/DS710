<li>Which of the tools introduced so far have you had previous experience with? Which were new?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have used Spyder and Anaconda as well as written .py files in Python. I really enjoy using a IDE like Spyder because it makes it easier to follow up on your code. I have never used Jupyter Notebooks before nor have I used the pytest library. Jupyter Notebooks reminds me R Markdown files when I initially interacted with it. I was very excited to utilize pytest because I have heard this term many times from the data scientists that report to me and it now makes more sense when my lead data scientist was describing test driven development to me.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>What part of this assignment was the most difficult?</li>
</ol>
<p>Figuring out how to make the pytests run, verifying my math on the second problem and understanding the functions. I could not figure out how to execute the pytest command in the console, but I was able to sort that out after a little research and I just added a ! to the command and it started giving me errors, which I then worked to resolve. The math was difficult because I was not trusting myself, but I wrote everything out and I was doing it correctly. I have always historically struggled with functions, but I just took some time to understand what was being done and followed the function through and understood how it worked. I will keep researching this to get better at it because I know how useful functions can be.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To what extent did you find yourself looking things up online? Describe the tactics you used to find the information you needed – and how you filtered out the content that wasn’t relevant or helpful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I used several different resources including our textbook to help with the errors that I was getting after the pytests had been run. I also utilized youtube videos and google along with chatgpt to figure out how to use Spyder to run the pytests.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I hope you made allies and friends in doing this assignment. Did you work with others? What was that like?</li>
</ol>
<p>I actually did not work with anyone on this assignment, but historically I have worked with other people on assignments before. I have some experience with Python, so it was easier for me to troubleshoot my mistakes myself whereas I did not have experience with R so it was more necessary in my last semester. I did read through Piazza posts for the pytest problem and that helped a little.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Describe one thing that you learned while working on this lesson that stood out as useful or interesting.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pytests can be so useful. I am pretty excited this semester to get better with functions and to be able to build my own pytests out to test my work. I think this will continue to help me help my data scientists and I also probably can use some of these principles to help the application engineers as we continue to improve the third party application that we have codeveloped with another company.</p>
